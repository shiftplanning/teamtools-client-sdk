# Teamtools Client SDK

#### Installation

Teamtools Client SDK can be installed by adding script tag to your html file:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/shiftplanning/teamtools-client-sdk/master/dst/tt.js"></script>
```
To prevent problems with some older browsers, we recommend putting the script tag in the `<head>` tag of your page, or as a direct descendant of the `<body>` at the end of your page.

#### Initialisation

Initialisation for events:

```javascript
 teamtools.init(accessToken, end_user_email, key)
```

Initialisations for gateways:

```javascript
 teamtools.initStripe(stripe_client_api_key)
```
```javascript
 teamtools.initBraintree(braintree_client_api_key)
```


### Tracking events

When you need to track event you need to call
```javascript
 teamtools.track(event_name, metadata)
```

### Generate credit card token

Converting credit card to safe token will only be possible after gateway initialisation
```javascript
 teamtools.gateway.createToken(cc_object, callback)
```

### Credit card object(cc_object) example

Only number, exp_month and exp_year are required.
